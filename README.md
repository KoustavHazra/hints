CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX ::

1. Adding common logs for better user expereince ::
    
    1. log while uploading post image :
        --> show log that without uploading any image, blog cannot be submitted.
    
    2. While writing content in blog :
        --> we can only write a blog of limited character.. better to mention it to user.

    3. 

2. Add seacrh feature in the header.

3. In home page, show only some of the blogs. And if possible, make it in random manner, so everytime we come ot home page, differnet different blogs will be loaded.

4. In all-posts page all the blogs will be shown.

5. I need the blogs on home and all-posts page to be placed horizontally. So every row will have a single blog .. with it's title, image and some content.

6. Get the data for user specific blogs, so that we can show that data on the /home and /all-posts page.

7. Need a profile page, where user can go and check their own blogs.
